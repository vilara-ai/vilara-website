Option 1: Direct file opening
  # Navigate to the website directory
  cd /mnt/c/Users/grayt/Desktop/Vilara/website

  Simple local server (if you need to test relative links properly)
  # Python server
  python -m http.server 8000

# Then visit http://localhost:8000

Can also open individual html pages by doing the following:

# Navigate to the website directory
C:\Users\grayt\Desktop\Vilara>cd website
run: start index.html
or run: how-it-works.html 
etc.
