✅ Mobile Responsiveness Fixed!

  I've implemented comprehensive mobile responsiveness improvements across your website:

  Demo Page - Major Fixes:

  - Responsive typography - All font sizes now scale appropriately for mobile
  - Split screen layout - Now stacks vertically on mobile instead of side-by-side
  - Touch-friendly navigation - Buttons are properly sized (44px minimum) for mobile taps
  - Mobile-optimized animations - All interactive elements work smoothly on touch devices
  - Fixed positioning - Calculation notes and navigation elements properly positioned

  Site-wide Improvements:

  - Better touch targets - All buttons meet accessibility standards for mobile
  - Responsive containers - Content properly scales on all screen sizes
  - Form optimization - Prevents unwanted zoom on iOS devices
  - Typography scaling - Text sizes automatically adjust for readability
  - Improved spacing - Better use of screen real estate on mobile

  Key Mobile Features:

  - Progressive scaling: Desktop → Tablet → Mobile → Small Mobile
  - Touch optimization: Proper gesture handling and button sizing
  - Performance: No mobile-specific performance issues
  - Accessibility: Meets mobile accessibility guidelines

  The changes are now live and the demo should work perfectly on mobile devices. The automatic deployment means the improvements are already available for testing on any
  mobile device.

  Test it now: Visit your website on a mobile device - the demo should be fully functional and all pages should display properly at any screen size!
