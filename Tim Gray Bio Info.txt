Joust (www.playjoust.com) was a first-of-its-kind social engagement platform that connected users through predictions, challenges and contests. From 2013 to 2017, Joust worked with leading media companies to engage their audiences in new ways by gamifying their content. The Joust experience was designed to easily integrate with partner websites and broadcasts. Joust’s customers included ABC, Fox Sports, ESPN, Discovery Communications, Callaway Golf, MTV, Hearst and Chicago Sun-Times. Although Joust had obtained tens of thousands of users with no meaningful marketing costs, our business model did not achieve sustainability and Joust was wound down in 2017. After a few years of additional development, Joust is set to re-launch in 2024, as a fully decentralized betting platform. The revised Joust includes extensive user tools and innovative bet matching technology that eliminates the need and costs associated with bookmaking.
