# Website Development for Vilara.ai

I need you to build a professional website for Vilara (www.vilara.ai), an AI-augmented ERP system that flexibly augments OR replaces traditional ERPs based on customer needs - with natural language commands.

## Key Business Context
Please review the business model at: `C:\Users\grayt\Desktop\Vilara\business docs\BUSINESS_MODEL_RECOMMENDATION.md`

**Core Value Proposition:**
- 95% faster than traditional ERPs (6 minutes → 17 seconds per task)
- $0 seat licenses (vs $75-200/user/month for traditional ERPs)
- Natural language interface - "like texting a smart colleague"
- Instant process changes without development costs
- Built on PostgreSQL + Nushell for total flexibility
- **Flexible deployment**: Augment existing ERP, gradually replace it, or start fresh

## Website Requirements

### 1. Homepage Structure
- Hero section with clear value prop: "The ERP that adapts instantly - to your business AND your existing systems"
- **Embed the presentation directly on the site** (copy from: `C:\Users\grayt\Desktop\Vilara\business docs\demo_deck\vilara presentation\vilara_presentation.html`)
  - Deploy at vilara.ai/demo or integrate into homepage
  - Not an external link - should be part of the site
- ROI calculator showing savings (based on company size/daily tasks)
- Three clear paths:
  - "Enhance My Current ERP" 
  - "Replace My Legacy System"
  - "Start Fresh with Vilara"
- Social proof section for early adopters
- Clear CTAs based on path chosen

### 2. Customer Journey Options
```

```

### 3. Demo Integration
